<h1>Introducing: <b>TTAPP</b></h1> - Short for time table app.


This app has been designed by two students of IIT Patna.

During this pandemic a lot of us have to attend online classes or meetings on a regular basis.
We also get assignments or work to complete.
You may even have to attend classes on different platforms like zoom, google meet, Webex and teams.
TTAPP makes it easier for you to attend online classes by organizing everything into one single place.
All you have to do is create your weekly time table in the app and add links.
Then TTAPP will keep providing you the link according to your time table and you can enter your class easily.
No hassle of finding links everday! Working on assignments is very easy with TTAPP as well.
Once an assignment has been given to you, any one user of the app can upload the assignment to the app and everybody else of the class will be able to see the assignment.
You can also store various resources for the assignment in TTAPP.
